One of the C++ programmers problems is to work with integers greater than 2^64-1 (we can save 0to 2^64-1 in unsigned long long int).  best Bignum implementation I have ever seen (Link) with CodeForces Community.

Its specifications are as follows:

Supported operations: + , -, / , * , % , ^(pow) , gcd , lcm , abs.

It is able to work with Standard Input/Output streams.

It can cast data to long long, string.

It uses fast multiplication.
